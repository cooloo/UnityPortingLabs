Unity Porting Labs

Plugins are used to support Windows Phone features and API not available in Unity's scripting mode. Unity uses Mono .NET, which has APIs not available for Windows Phone .NET.

PLUGIN SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS PHONE 8:

Completed:

- System.IO.Directory

Windows Phone 8 Features:

I have code for Live Tiles scheduling and local notifications, player control, game flow navigation (back button), etc. However, due to time constraints, I'll share it when time permits. 

Visual Studio Code Snippets:
To use the code snippets, add them to your local Visual Studio folder, (the path may look like: D:\Visual Studio 2013\Code Snippets). In Visual Studio, Tools > Code Snippets Manager, select Visual C#, then click Add to select the path where you have your code snippets.

In the code, you can just use the short keys: Ctrl + k, x, to insert a snippet.

System:
Windows 8.1 Enterprise
Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate
Unity 4.3.4


Thanks for your support & patience.
