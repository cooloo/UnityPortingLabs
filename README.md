Unity Porting Labs
====================

Unity Porting Labs demo game and plugins

Open: DemoGame/WP8/DemoGame.sln
The Visual Studio solution will contain the Windows Phone solution file, Unity's scripting solution file, and the WP8 plugins solution files.

Plugins is a good way to support Windows Phone features and API not available in Unity's scripting mode. Unity uses Mono .NET, which has APIs not available for Windows Phone .NET.

PLUGIN SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS PHONE 8:

Completed:
- System.IO.File
- System.IO.Directory

In progress:
- WeChat sharing
- In App Purchase

Windows Phone 8 Features:

I have code for Live Tiles scheduling and local notifications, player control, game flow navigation (back button), etc. However, due to time constraints, I'll share it when time permits. 

Thanks for your patience.
